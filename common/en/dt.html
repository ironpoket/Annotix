<h5>Age</h5>
<p>
  Ageism or age discrimination is discrimination and stereotyping based on the
  grounds of someone's age. It is a set of beliefs, norms, and values which used
  to justify discrimination or subordination based on a person's age. Ageism is
  most often directed toward elderly people, or adolescents and children.

<h5>Caste</h5>
<p>
  According to UNICEF and Human Rights Watch, caste discrimination affects an
  estimated 250 million people worldwide and is mainly prevalent in parts of
  Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Japan) and Africa. As of
  2011, there were 200 million Dalits or Scheduled Castes (formerly known as
  untouchables) in India.

<h5>Disability</h5>
<p>
  Discrimination against people with disabilities in favor of people who are not
  is called ableism or disablism. Disability discrimination, which treats
  non-disabled individuals as the standard of 'normal living', results in public
  and private places and services, educational settings, and social services
  that are built to serve 'standard' people, thereby excluding those with
  various disabilities. Studies have shown that disabled people not only need
  employment in order to be provided with the opportunity to earn a living but
  they also need employment in order to sustain their mental health and
  well-being. Work fulfils a number of basic needs for an individual such as
  collective purpose, social contact, status, and activity. A person with a
  disability is often found to be socially isolated and work is one way to
  reduce his or her isolation.

<h5>Language</h5>
<p>
  Linguistic discrimination (also called glottophobia, linguicism and
  languagism) is unfair treatment of people which is based on their use of
  language and the characteristics of their speech, including their first
  language, their accent, the perceived size of their vocabulary (whether or not
  the speaker uses complex and varied words), their modality, and their syntax.
  For example, an Occitan speaker in France will probably be treated differently
  from a French speaker. Based on a difference in use of language, a person may
  automatically form judgments about another person's wealth, education, social
  status, character or other traits, which may lead to discrimination.
</p>

<h5>Nationality</h5>
<p>
  Discrimination on the basis of nationality is usually included in employment
  laws. It is sometimes referred to as bound together with racial discrimination
  although it can be separate. It may vary from laws that stop refusals of
  hiring based on nationality, asking questions regarding origin, to
  prohibitions of firing, forced retirement, compensation and pay, etc., based
  on nationality.
</p>

<h5>Ethnicity</h5>
<p>
  Racial and ethnic discrimination differentiates individuals on the basis of
  real and perceived racial and ethnic differences and leads to various forms of
  the ethnic penalty.
</p>

<h5>Gender identity</h5>
<p>
  Sexism is a form of discrimination based on a person's sex or gender. It has
  been linked to stereotypes and gender roles and may include the belief that
  one sex or gender is intrinsically superior to another.
</p>

<h5>Religious beliefs</h5>
<p>
  Religious discrimination is valuing or treating people or groups differently
  because of what they do or do not believe in or because of their feelings
  towards a given religion.
</p>

<h5>Sexual orientation</h5>
<p>
  One's sexual orientation is a predilection for homosexuality, heterosexuality,
  or bisexuality. Like most minority groups, homosexuals and bisexuals are
  vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination from the majority group.
